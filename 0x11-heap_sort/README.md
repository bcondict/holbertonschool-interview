# 0x11. Heap Sort

Here is the task I solve to practive interview excercise. The solution the task is on the file with the same name than the task.

My challenge for you is to try to solve all of this task and after see the way I did it.

### Requirements
#### General
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.

#### More Info
or this project you are given the following `print_array` function:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
```C
/**
 * print_array - Prints an array of integers
 *
 * @array: The array to be printed
 * @size: Number of elements in @array
 */
void print_array(const int *array, size_t size)
{
    size_t i;

    i = 0;
    while (array && i < size)
    {
        if (i > 0)
            printf(", ");
        printf("%d", array[i]);
        ++i;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

- Our file `print_array.c` will be compiled with your function during the correction.
- Please declare the prototype of the function `print_array` in your `sort.h` header file

Please, note this format is used for Big O notation:
- `O(1)`
- `O(n)`
- `O(n!)`
- n square -> `O(n^2)`
- log(n) -> `O(log(n))`
- n * log(n) -> `O(nlog(n))`
- …

Please use the “short” notation (don’t use constants). Example: O(nk) or O(wn) should be written O(n). If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have an empty line at the end.

### Tasks
#### 0. Heap sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Heap sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort) algorithm

- Prototype: `void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
- You must implement the `sift-down` heap sort algorithm
- You’re expected to print the `array` after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Heap sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

## Compiler
```sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-heap_sort.c print_array.c -o 0-heap
```

## Usage
```sh
$ ./0-heap
