## Requirements
### General
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)

## Task
#### 0.Change comes from within
Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

- Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`
- Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet `total`
    - If `total` is 0 or less, return `0`
    - If `total` cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return `-1`
- `coins` is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
- The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than `0`
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
- Your solution’s runtime will be evaluated in this task

### Usage
```sh
$ ./0-main.py
