# holbertonschool-interview

This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of the interview preparation curriculum at Holberton School. Each project focuses on different algorithmic concepts and problem-solving techniques, helping students enhance their skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Projects
### 0x00-lockboxes
This project explores the concept of searching and manipulating lists in Python. You will implement a function to determine if all the boxes in a list can be unlocked by finding the correct keys.

### 0x01-insert_in_sorted_linked_list
The 0x01-insert_in_sorted_linked_list project focuses on manipulating linked lists in C. You will implement a function to insert a node into a sorted singly linked list while maintaining the sorted order.

### 0x02-heap_insert
In this project, you will work with heaps and binary trees in C. You will implement a function to insert a value into a binary max heap and maintain the heap property.

### 0x03-minimum_operations
The 0x03-minimum_operations project explores problem-solving and algorithmic thinking in Python. You will solve a puzzle using a specific set of operations and determine the minimum number of operations required to reach a target.

### 0x04-sandpiles
In this project, you will work with 2D arrays in C and implement a function to perform the "sandpile" operation, which involves toppling grains of sand and redistributing them in a grid.

### 0x05-linked_list_palindrome
The 0x05-linked_list_palindrome project focuses on linked list manipulation in Python. You will implement a function to determine if a linked list is a palindrome.

### 0x06-log_parsing
In this project, you will work with file I/O in Python and process log files. You will implement a script to parse and aggregate data from log files.

### 0x07-linked_list_cycle
The 0x07-linked_list_cycle project explores the concept of cycle detection in linked lists. You will implement a function to determine if a linked list contains a cycle.

### 0x08-palindrome_integer
In this project, you will work with integer manipulation in C. You will implement a function to check if an integer is a palindrome.

### 0x09-utf8_validation
The 0x09-utf8_validation project focuses on bit manipulation and validation in C. You will implement a function to check if a given array of data represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

### 0x0A-slide_line
In this project, you will work with arrays and sliding operations in C. You will implement a function to slide and merge an array of integers according to a specific set of rules.

### 0x0B-menger
The 0x0B-menger project explores recursive patterns and fractals in Python. You will implement a function to draw a 2D Menger sponge fractal.

### 0x0C-nqueens
In this project, you will work with backtracking and the N-queens problem in Python. You will implement a solution to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard without any two queens threatening each other.
